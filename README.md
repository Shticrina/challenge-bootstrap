### Training about Bootstrap framework

**In this exercise we have to:**

- Recreate 2 layouts (using whatever text and images) trying to get as close as possible without writing CSS
- Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
- Style the navigation bar using only the framework
- Make the grid responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.
- When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text. You can use the bootstrap tooltips for this.
